# Parkour

```
/race help
```

Shows this page. But you already found that out, presumably.

```
/race set [name]
```

This creates a new race (with a name of your choice). Not entering the name will create
one with a name like race23. Step on pressure plates, push and pull levers and buttons
to create waypoints.

```
/race stop
```

Call this when you're done creating a race. It will save the most recently stepped on plate/button/levers
as the finish line.

```
/race
```

If you are not yet in a race, this will point your compass to the nearest race.  
If you are in a race, this will tell you information about the current race, including 
how long you've been racing, and the time since the last waypoint. Your compass will 
already be pointing to the next waypoint.
